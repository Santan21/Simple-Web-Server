=> Server was created using **createServer** and a callback function that is executed each time a new request hit the server was passed in.

=> Incoming requests were listened on the local host IP '**127.0.0.1**' and on the port **8000**. Once the code was running, the request was made by hitting the **(127.0.01:8000)** URL
